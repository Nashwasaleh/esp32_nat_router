# ESP32 NAT Router Project

This project sets up an ESP32 microcontroller as a Network Address Translation (NAT) router. 
It allows multiple devices to access the internet using a single public IP address via the ESP32 Wi-Fi network.

## Project Goals
- Set up ESP32 as a NAT router
- Flash firmware using esptool
- Test connectivity and internet access for multiple devices
- Document challenges and learning outcomes

## Requirements
- ESP32 board
- USB cable
- Python and Esptool
- Internet access for firmware download

## Setup Instructions
1. Install esptool:
   ```bash
   pip install esptool
   ```
2. Erase existing firmware:
   ```bash
   esptool.py --chip esp32 erase_flash
   ```
3. Flash downloaded NAT router firmware:
   ```bash
   esptool.py --chip esp32 --port COMX write_flash -z 0x1000 firmware.bin
   ```
4. Connect to ESP32 Wi-Fi (SSID: ESP32_NAT_Router)
5. Access configuration at [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1) and input main Wi-Fi credentials

## Testing
- Connect multiple devices to the ESP32 NAT Router network
- Ensure devices can access the internet
- Use ping and speed tests to verify performance

## Challenges
- Driver issues with USB ports
- Wi-Fi stability concerns
- **Solutions:** Driver updates, router repositioning

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained experience with ESP32 hardware
- Learned about NAT, esptool, and embedded network configuration

## Future Improvements
- Add web dashboard to monitor connected devices
- Implement basic traffic analytics
- Integrate VPN tunneling
